# Quartz

Quartz is a powerful command/event scheduling system for (currently) Paper-based Minecraft servers.

- Schedule events and commands using the powerful cron syntax.
- "Events" have start/end times and can run commands, display messages, play sounds, and more.
- "Commands" are literally just commands set to run at specific times.
- Powerful configuration system lets you control the displays and formatting of both events and command output.
- All output configurations support Minimessage formatting and placeholders from PlaceholderAPI.
- Commented configuration files help explain the options.
